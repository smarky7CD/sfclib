# smarky's fun C-library

This is my personal C-library. Some of it may be useful for projects, other stuff is just for fun/experimentation. Feel free to play with. I usually work on this when I have some exceedingly rare free time.

## To-Do List

* Heaps
* Matrix
* Graphs (Adjancency List and Adjaceny Matrix)
* Stream
* Hash Table
